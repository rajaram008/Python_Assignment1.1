## Python Assignment 1.1 ##
## Task 1.2 Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5, between 2000 and 3200 (both included). The numbers obtained should be printed in a
## comma-separated sequence on a single line.

## Create an empty List
List1=[]

for i in range(2000,3200):
    if (i%7==0 and i%5)!=0:
        List1.append(i)
print (List1)
